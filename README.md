Visualization Insights:


	1	Distribution of Customer Travel Distance:
	•	The histogram shows most customers travel within 5000-7500 meters
	•	There's a strong right-skewed distribution, meaning fewer customers travel longer distances
	•	Clear peak in the short-distance range, suggesting local customer base is crucial
	2	Sales Volume by Distance Band:
	•	Highest sales volume in the "Under 5km" band
	•	Sharp decline in sales as distance increases
	•	Very few sales beyond 15km radius
	3	Store Performance by Customer Distance:
	•	High-performing stores (blue) generally have a mix of close and medium-distance customers
	•	Some outlier stores are performing well despite higher average customer distances
	•	Under-performing stores (red) tend to have more scattered distance patterns
	4	Monthly Sales Distribution:
	•	Relatively consistent sales across months
	•	No extreme seasonal variations in Q1
	•	Stable revenue pattern suggests consistent market demand
	5	Revenue Distribution by Store Performance Tier:
	•	Clear separation between performance tiers
	•	High-performing stores show significantly higher revenue spread
	•	Average-performing stores show consistent revenue patterns
Marketing Recommendations:

	1	Primary Market Focus:

	◦	High-performing stores: Maintain current reach, focus on customer retention
	◦	Average stores: Increase marketing in 5-10km radius to expand customer base
	◦	Under-performing stores: Intensify local marketing within 5km
	3	Geographic Targeting:

	◦	Invest more marketing resources in areas with proven customer density
	◦	Consider store location when planning new promotional activities
